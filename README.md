## Auditor Notes

This section provides guidance for security auditors reviewing this project.

### 1. Smart Contract Audit (`src/Multisig.sol`)

**This is the primary component requiring security verification.**

#### Contract Overview

- **Purpose**: Multi-signature wallet for USDT transfers requiring N-of-M owner approvals
- **Lines of Code**: ~294 lines of Solidity
- **Compiler**: Solidity ^0.8.13
- **Dependencies**: OpenZeppelin contracts (audited, industry standard)

#### Security Checklist

| Area | What to Verify |
|------|----------------|
| **Access Control** | Only owners can submit/approve/revoke transactions |
| **Threshold Logic** | Threshold must be > 0 and ≤ owner count |
| **No Backdoors** | No admin functions to drain funds or bypass threshold |
| **No Privileged Roles** | All owners have equal rights, no super-admin |
| **Reentrancy** | Protected via OpenZeppelin `ReentrancyGuard` |
| **Integer Overflow** | Solidity 0.8.x has built-in overflow protection |
| **Fund Withdrawal** | Only via approved multisig transactions |

#### Key Security Properties to Verify

1. **No single owner can withdraw funds** - Requires `threshold` approvals
2. **No external party can withdraw funds** - Only owners can interact
3. **No hidden owner addition** - No functions to add/remove owners post-deployment
4. **Immutable USDT address** - Cannot be changed after deployment
5. **Balance verification** - Transfer success verified by balance change (handles legacy USDT quirks)

#### Attack Vectors to Test

- [ ] Can a non-owner submit/approve transactions?
- [ ] Can threshold be bypassed?
- [ ] Can the same owner approve twice?
- [ ] Can executed transactions be re-executed?
- [ ] Reentrancy during execution?
- [ ] Front-running attacks?
- [ ] Self-transfer edge cases?

#### External Dependencies

| Dependency | Source | Audit Status |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| `@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol` | [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) | ✅ Audited multiple times |
| `@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol` | [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) | ✅ Audited multiple times |

OpenZeppelin contracts are the industry standard and have been audited by Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin's internal team, and others. See: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/master/audits

---

### 2. TRC20 USDT Reference (`TRC20_USDT/`)

**These contracts are NOT deployed by this project - they are reference copies.**

#### Purpose

The `TRC20_USDT/` folder contains an exact copy of the USDT TRC20 token deployed on TRON mainnet by Tether. This is used for:
- Local testing against realistic USDT behavior
- Understanding legacy Solidity 0.4.x behavior (no return value on `transfer()`)

#### Verification Required

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ✅ **Source verification** | Compare against Tether's official deployed contract on TRON |
| ✅ **No modifications** | Verify no backdoors or changes were added |
| ⚠️ **Trust assumption** | We trust Tether's deployed contract as it holds billions in value |

#### Official TRON USDT Contract

- **Mainnet**: `TR7NHqjeKQxGTCi8q8ZY4pL8otSzgjLj6t`
- **Source**: https://tronscan.org/#/contract/TR7NHqjeKQxGTCi8q8ZY4pL8otSzgjLj6t/code

**Action**: Diff the `TRC20_USDT/TetherToken.sol` against the official deployed source to verify no modifications.

### 3. Flutter App Dependencies

The mobile/desktop app uses these third-party packages. Auditors should verify:
- No malicious code in dependencies
- Secure cryptographic implementations
- No data exfiltration

#### Critical Dependencies (Crypto/Security)

| Package | Version | Purpose | Security Notes |
|---------|---------|---------|----------------|
| `web3dart` | ^2.7.3 | Ethereum/EVM interaction | ✅ [Open source](https://github.com/xclud/web3dart), 500+ GitHub stars, widely used |
| `pointycastle` | ^3.9.1 | Cryptographic primitives | ✅ [Dart port of BouncyCastle](https://github.com/bcgit/pc-dart), well-established crypto library |
| `encrypt` | ^5.0.3 | AES encryption | ✅ [Open source](https://github.com/nickvanderlinden/encrypt), uses pointycastle |
| `bs58check` | ^1.0.2 | Base58Check encoding | ✅ Standard Bitcoin address encoding |

#### Non-Critical Dependencies

| Package | Version | Purpose | Security Notes |
|---------|---------|---------|----------------|
| `http` | ^1.2.0 | HTTP client | ✅ Official Dart team package |
| `provider` | ^6.1.2 | State management | ✅ Flutter team recommended |
| `shared_preferences` | ^2.3.3 | Local storage | ✅ Official Flutter plugin |
| `intl` | ^0.19.0 | Internationalization | ✅ Official Dart team package |
| `convert` | ^3.1.1 | Encoding utilities | ✅ Official Dart team package |
| `cupertino_icons` | ^1.0.8 | iOS icons | ✅ Official Flutter package |

#### Dependency Verification Commands

```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities (if using OSV scanner)
cd app && flutter pub outdated

# View dependency tree
cd app && flutter pub deps

# Audit package sources
# All packages can be inspected at https://pub.dev/packages/<package_name>
```

#### Key Security Considerations for App

1. **Private Key Storage**: How are private keys stored? (should use secure enclave/keychain)
2. **RPC Communication**: Is HTTPS enforced? Certificate pinning?
3. **Input Validation**: Are addresses and amounts validated before sending?
4. **No Telemetry**: Verify no analytics/tracking that could leak sensitive data

---

### 4. Test Coverage

Run the test suite to verify contract behavior:

```bash
# Run all tests with verbose output
just test

# Run with gas report
just test-gas

# View test file
cat test/Multisig.t.sol
```

Tests cover:
- Constructor validation
- Transaction submission
- Multi-owner approval flow
- Threshold enforcement
- Edge cases (zero amounts, duplicate approvals, etc.)

---

### 5. Audit Recommendations

1. **Smart Contract**: Focus on `src/Multisig.sol` - verify no fund extraction without threshold
2. **TRC20 Reference**: Diff against official Tether source - should be identical
3. **Flutter App**: Review key management and RPC security
4. **Dependencies**: All are open source and verifiable on pub.dev and GitHub
